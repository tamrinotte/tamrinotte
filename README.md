# Welcome to Tamrinotte's Open Source Project Hub ðŸ‘‹ 

Please don't be shy to share what ever you have done. And, please follow the coding conventions. 

## Coding Conventions
 
Objects - Camel cases -> userInput = input("Enter your input here: ") 
Files and Folders - lower snake case -> static_files
Packages - package name is always written in all-lowercase -> my.first.application
Methods - Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. -> runTest()
! It's important for us to comment our code. So others can understand what is going on. 

## Documentation

We want to document every single project of ours. So, we will appericiate any help on documentation.
